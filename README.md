# z80-maxam-sublime
Syntax definition &amp; theme for z80 (Maxam) assembly code in Sublime Text 2

## To use
I haven't had time to find out how to release it as a proper package but, on Windows at least, you just need to extract into ```{User-Directory}/AppData/roaming/Sublime Text 2/Packages/z80```. It should then appear as an option in View|Syntax menu

## Notes
Was written for Sublime Text 2 but may also work in Sublime Text 3. I use it to write Maxam/WinAPE code so it may need slight tweaking to work properly with other assemblers. It's pretty unsophisticated at the moment but it does the job

If you're interested in writing z80 for the Amstrad CPC then you may find [this page](http://borilla.co.uk/z80.html) useful. It contains a list of available instructions and "nop" timings for each
